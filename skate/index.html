      <h1>skate. Project</h1>
      <p>skate. is an open world skating game on ROBLOX where players free skate and do challenges to become the richest skater.</p>
      <p>This article is around the roadmap for the game, and letting you, the user, help us bring this project to life!</p>
      <h2>About cooprtech</h1>
      <p>cooprtech started as just some kid in a room. cooprtech has made the very unpopular indie games CatFight.me, Lookbeats, and assisted in some unofficial ROBLOX work in the past.</p>
      <h2>Why the switch to ROBLOX?</h2>
      <p>cooprtech isn't necessarily money-chasing, but from what is understood, ROBLOX has offered younger indie groups better opporunities. The skate. project began on November 16, 2024, by a ROBLOX Employer post. This helped us gather the best developers, and people who know what they're doing when it comes to larger projects like skate.</p>
      <p>Enough about the team now.</p>
      <h1>What is skate.?</h1>
      <p>In short, an open sports world where everything is interactive. Think of it like a tycoon. Players do cool tricks, get noticed by imaginary "celebrities" who help the player sell their product. (In this case, the product is skateboards) We also wanted to give users an engaging experience. There are nearly infinite tricks and challenges! Tricks can be book, or automatically generated if it's REALLY impressive! Challenges are pretty much infinite. They are put together in random locations with random requirements. Completing these requirements let the player sell a certain amount of boards. (most likely based on difficulty)</p>
      <h1>Will skate. be free?</h1>
      <p>Not yet.</p>
      <p>The game will release at a price of maybe $1 USD worth of Robux. Eventually, if the game isn't performing well that way, it could be completely free! We will be putting a lot into this project, so we're hoping for a lot back.</p>
      <p>That's about all we can share about the game...</p>
      <h2>Release Date</h2>
      <p>No specific date yet! Expect around early 2025.</p>
